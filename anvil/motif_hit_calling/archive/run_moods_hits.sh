# TFM_TFM_PATH = modisco hdf5 path
# TFM_TOMTOM_PATH = tomtom tsv path
# TFM_SHAP_PATH = interpretations bigwig

# TFM_MOODS_DIR = output dir
# METHOD_INPUT = how to calculate contributions score for the hits? Look at Modes supported note below
# TFM_REFERENCE_PATH = reference path

### Modes supported METHOD_INPUT
### (1) sum = Take the sum of the contribution scores within hit window (preferes longer motifs)
### (2) mean = Take the mean of the contribution scores within hit window (prefers shorter motifs)
### (3) sum_norm = Take the sum of the contribution scores within hit window (preferes longer motifs) and divide by the mean of the total score in peak region
### (4) mean_norm = Take the mean of the contribution scores within hit window (prefers shorter motifs) and divide by the mean of the total score in peak region
### (3) and (4) Modes account for background - so you should get hits in regions with low overall importance
### I use mean_norm mode

### Make sure your peak regions (input to the argument TFM_PEAKS_PATH) are merged 
### Final output - overlaps_resolved_based_on_cwm_activations_normed.bed
### NOTE: The code outputs lot of intermediate files at every stage - I can do a call to walk you through this.
