Release History
===============


Version 2.0.7
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Adds an error if the window is larger than the sequences.


Version 2.0.6
==============

modisco
-------
	
	- Adds an explicit casting of the one-hot encoded sequence and the
	attributions to 32-bit floats. This allows files to be compressed to
	16-bit floats to save space.


Version 2.0.5
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Removes the use of the Arial Rounded font, hopefully reducing the number
	of warnings produced.


Version 2.0.4
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Removed the need to supply both a MEME file with motifs and a directory
	with extracted PFMs. The PFMs will be read directly from the MEME file now.


modisco
-------

	- Removed the need to supply both a MEME file with motifs and a directory
	with extracted PFMs. The PFMs will be read directly from the MEME file now.


Version 2.0.3
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Fixed a minor error where results would not display properly if fewer
	than the specified number of TOMTOM hits were found for a motif.


Version 2.0.2
==============

report.py
---------
	
	- Fixed a display issue where the patterns were being displayed in the
	wrong order.


Version 2.0.1
==============

Highlights
----------

	- A minor bug and a minor convenience issue have been resolved.


aggregator.py
-------------

	- A minor bug was fixed where, when collapsing patterns in the final step,
	some patterns would have no seqlets after the filtering step and the code
	would crash. Now, if a pattern has no seqlets after the filtering, it is
	ignored.


report.py
---------

	- The patterns are now displayed in numeric order 1-10, followed by 11-20,
	etc., as opposed to by alphabetical order 1, 10-19, 2, 20-29, etc.


Version 2.0.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- This is the first complete release that includes breaking changes compared
	with the original code. They are detailed below.


affinitymat.py
--------------

	- When calculating the coarse-grained resolution, an argsort is done to find
	the nearest neighbors of each seqlet. This is done in numpy using a sorting
	algorithm that is not stable. This new version uses "mergesort" instead of
	the default "quicksort", as it is a stable algorithm. This change allows
	us to use numpy within numba, assigning more work to each thread, and
	ultimately speeding the code up ~2-3x. 


core.py
-------

	- AggregatedSeqlet was renamed SeqletSet.


gapped_kmer.py
--------------

	- A bug in the original codebase where the nucleotide identity was done
	on the argmax of the contribution score, rather than the one-hot encoded
	sequence, caused incorrect nucleotide calls for positions that had a
	negative contribution. This effects only the gapped k-mer representation
	used to calculate coarse-grained representations, not the found patterns.


io.py
-----

	- This code was added to handle saving the outputs of the TFMoDISco function
	to disk and the conversion of the old outputs into the new format.


tfmodisco.py
------------

	- The output of TFMoDISco is now a tuple of two lists, where the first
	list contains the positive patterns and the second list contains the
	negative patterns. Each pattern is represented as a `SeqletSet` object.


Version 1.0.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- This is the first complete release that perfectly reproduces the outputs
	of the original TF-MoDISco code.
